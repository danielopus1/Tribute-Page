        Supporting, discussing, and promoting Apple products have been

        Steve not because of what he's done for us in the past few years. We owe 
        him because of what has happened the last 15 years at Apple will change 
        our lives forever, or at least the next few hundred years.
        
        I'm grateful to Steve personally and professionally. May God give grace
